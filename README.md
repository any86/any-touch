## Get Started

```javascript
import AnyTouch from 'any-touch';

// monitored element
const el = document.getElementById('box');

// Start monitoring gesture changes on el
const at = new AnyTouch(el);

// The pan event fires when dragging
at.on('pan', (e) => {
    // e contains information such as displacement/velocity/direction
    console.log(e);
});
```

The pan here is called [gesture event](#gesture). e is the [event object](#event), which contains data such as "position/speed/zoom/angle",

### 👋Gesture

Each state of the gesture corresponds to an event.

#### Combining events

You can listen to multiple events through the array, such as listening to panleft and panright at the same time, so that you can listen to "x-axis dragging".

```javascript
at.on(['panleft', 'panright'], () => {
    console.log('Drag on the x-axis');
});
```

[:rocket: back to directory](#directory)

### 🍭 Event

When the event is triggered, data such as "position/speed/zoom/angle" can be obtained.

```javascript
at.on('pan', (event) => {
    // event contains data such as speed/direction
});
```

## Typescript

If the event function is bound in the vue template, the type of the event object cannot be deduced, so we need to manually annotate it ourselves.

```html
<div @tap="onTap"></div>
```

```typescript
// xxx.vue
import type { AnyTouchEvent } from 'any-touch';
function onTap(e: AnyTouchEvent) {
    // It can be correctly deduced that there is an x attribute on e
    console.log(e.x);
}
```
